# Weather & GIF app
## Try it out: https://lynndz3.github.io/weather-gif-app/

## Description
<p>This app utilizes 2 free third-party APIs: https://openweathermap.org/ and https://giphy.com/.</p>

<p>When a user searches for a location, the app fetches current weather data and a related, random gif and displays both to the user.</p>
<p>After inputting a location, the user can press the "search" button with their mouse or press "enter" on their keyboard.</p> 

## The Why
<p>I built this app to practice a few things:
<ol>
    <li>Async / Await
    <li>Integrating with third party APIs (giphy.com & weather)
    <li>Fetch API
    <li>Javascript / event listeners
